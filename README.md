# CleanSkies Live â€” V2 (Layout & Theme Only)

This is a fresh scaffold focused solely on layout, theme, and design. No backend, no real APIs. It includes:
- React + Vite + Tailwind
- NASA-inspired dark theme with vibrant accents
- Pages: Home (map), Login, Signup, Profile
- Placeholder data and a mock API layer (frontend-only)
- Leaflet-based map placeholder (no API keys required)

Important:
- You asked to preserve only the README from the previous app. Paste your original README contents over this file if you want to carry it forward here.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Where to Put Real APIs Later
- Replace `src/lib/api.js` methods with actual calls
- Replace `src/data/airQualitySample.json` with real data sources

## Tech
- React 18, React Router
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Leaflet + React Leaflet (no keys required)
